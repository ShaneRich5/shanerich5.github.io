title: How I built my blog

I've always wanted a place to write down what I'm learning, and at the same time, I've been curious about how MDX works. The idea of writing posts in Markdown but being able to sprinkle in custom React components felt like the perfect excuse to finally spin up a blog.

In this post I'll break down how the first iteration of how my blog works so you can replicate it yourself.

## The Stack
- **NextJS** provides routing and support for MDX out of the box.
- **MDX** is the main reason I started thisâ€”because I want to build posts that aren't just text but can include charts, demos, or interactive snippets.
- **Github Pages** to provide a free and simple place to deploy to, which allows me to primarily focus on writing.

## Getting Started

#### Step 1: Create the project

```bash
npx create-next-app my-mdx-blog
cd my-mdx-blog
```

This creates the NextJS project with all the boilerplate.

#### Step 2: Add MDX

Install the packages:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx next-mdx-remote
```

Update the `next.config.js`

```ts
import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";

const withMDX = createMDX({
  extension: /\.(md|mdx)$/,
});

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: "export", // enables static export
  images: {
    unoptimized: true, // Github Pages cannot optimize images
  },
  experimental: {
    mdxRs: false,
  },
  pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx", "ts", "tsx"],
};

export default withMDX(nextConfig);
```

Now Next.js will recognize .mdx files alongside normal pages.

#### Step 3: Write a post in MDX

Create the file `app/posts/hello-world.mdx`:

```mdx
---
title: "Hello World"
date: "2025-09-10"
---

# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

This is my first post written in **MDX**.
```

That's the magic of MDXâ€”content and interactivity in one place. Start your app using `npm run dev` and confirm that it works by visiting http://localhost:3000/posts/hello-world.

#### Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Push your code to a new GitHub repo.
2. If your blog will live under a repo subpath, set basePath in next.config.js.
3. Build and export your site:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run export
  ```
  This creates an out/ folder.
  Deploy the out/ folder to GitHub Pages:
  ```bash
  npx gh-pages -d out
  ```
5. Enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings and point it to the gh-pages branch.

Your blog should now be live.
